# General parameters
project_name: OptimOTU_in_PipeCraft2

# Files to work with. Specify the extension, e.g. fastq.gz / fq.gz / fastq / fq.
# The default selects any of these
# Regular expression syntax is allowed.
# Only used if no custom sample table is given.
file_extension: "fastq.gz"

# Specify sequence orientation.
  # "fwd" = all sequences are expected to be in 5'-3' orientation.
  # "rev" = all sequences are expected to be in 3'-5' orientation.
  # "mixed" = the orientation of seqs is expected to be mixed (5'-3' and 3'-5)
  # "custom" = the orientation of different files is given in a custom sample table (see below)
  #   In this case there should be a column "orient" which has values "fwd", "rev", or "mixed"
  # if seqs are "mixed", but using "fwd" setting, then some valid seqs (or samples) will be lost.
  # if seqs are "fwd", but using "mixed", then ERROR.
orient: mixed

# Sample parameters
# custom primer trimming parameters per sample can be given as columns in the
# sample table.
custom_sample_table: FALSE

# Added reference sequences (leave blank or use NULL if none)
# "table" should be an Excel *.xlsx spreadsheet, with (at least) two columns in the
# first sheet:
#  Culture_ID: unique identifier for the sequence, muse _exactly_ match the sequence
#    name in "fasta"
#  Protax_synonym: comma-separated taxonomy string for the new ID, starting with
#    kingdom.  Be sure to match the taxonomy used by protax, including spelling!

### parallelism settings ###
############################

# maximum number of ASV sequences to process in a single batch
max_batchsize: 10000

# for parallel execution (crew or clustermq) how many workers to launch for
# each sequencing run and orientation. 2 will yield maximum parallelism in most
# situations.
workers_per_seqrun: 2

# regardless of the number of sequencing runs, the maximum and minimum number of
# parallel jobs to run. For crew, the number of jobs actually launched may be
# less than min_jobs if additional jobs would have nothing to do.
max_jobs: 100

### primer trimming settings ###

trimming:
  max_err: 0.2        # max error rate (float; e.g 0.2 = 20% error rate) in the primer sequence; or number of mismatches (int; e.g. 1 = 1 mismatch)

### quality filtering settings ###
##################################
filtering:
  maxEE_R1: 1           # max expected errors for R1 reads
  maxEE_R2: 1           # max expected errors for R2 reads

####################################
### tag-jumps filtering settings ###
####################################
# comment out this section or set tag_jump to FALSE to omit this step
tag_jump:
  f: 0.05             # expected cross-talk rate
  p: 1                # power to rise the exponent

###############################
### Amplicon model settings ###
###############################
# comment out this section or set model_type to "none" to skip this step
# statistical sequence models are used for several purposes:
#  1) aligning ASVs prior to use of protaxA and/or NuMt detection
#  2) filtering ASVs to remove spurious sequences
amplicon_model:
  model_type: CM      # allowed values are CM, HMM, and none
  model_file: data/ITS3_ITS4.cm

  # model filter will be skipped if amplicon_model$model_type is "none",
  # or if this section is commented out.
  # these values will need to be tuned for different amplicons/models
  model_filter:
    max_model_start: 5    # the match must start at this point in the model or earlier
    min_model_end: 140    # the match must end at this point in the model or later
    min_model_score: 50   # the match bit score must be at least this

  # producing aligned sequences will be skipped if the value is false
  model_align: no

  # numt filter will be skipped if the value is false
  # numt filter requires model_type == "HMM" and model_align == TRUE
  numt_filter: no

### Feature-by-sample table ###
###############################
# Feature = ASV/OTU/x
repeats: "sum"     # what to to do with the samples that have the SAME NAME.
                    # "sum" = merging the replicates
                    # "error" = STOPs the run if duplicated sample names are detected.
dense_table: no

#########################
### Control sequences ###
#########################
# Two types of control sequences are supported:
# 1) spike-in sequences: sequences that are added to the samples before PCR
#    These sequences are expected to be present in every sample, even
#    most types of negative control.
# 2) positive control sequences: sequences that are added to only a few specific
#    positive control samples.  These sequences are expected to be present only
#    in the positive control samples, and their presence in other samples is
#    indicative of cross-contamination. (Either in the lab or "tag-switching").
# In practice both types are treated the same by the pipeline, they are just
# reported separately.
#
# The sequences should be in a fasta file.
# Either or both type of control can be omitted by leaving the value blank,
# omitting it completely, or setting it to a value that evaluates to false.
control:
  spike: protaxFungi/addedmodel/amptk_synmock.fasta
  positive: no

### Protax settings ###
#######################
protax:
  aligned: no # "yes" assumes all reference and query sequences are aligned
  location: "protaxFungi" # directory where protax is
  #### Ranks ####
  # Ranks should be listed from most inclusive to lease inclusive.
  # The first rank(s) may be given with values (e.g. "- kingdom: Fungi" instead
  # of just "- kingdom"). This means that the rank(s) are not assigned by
  # Protax, but rather are assumed to already be known by Protax; i.e. they are
  # the root of the classification.
  ranks:
    - kingdom: Fungi
    - phylum
    - class
    - order
    - family
    - genus
    - species

###################################
### Outgroup reference settings ###
###################################
# The outgroup reference should be taxonomically annotated sequences which
# include not only the ingroup (i.e., those sequences which Protax can identify)
# but also (ideally) all other groups which could conceivably be encountered
# with the chosen marker.
# Optionally, the taxonomic annotations can be given in another file.
# (The formatting in this case is idiosyncratic, related to the release format
# of Unite.)
# If given, this is also the file used for reference-based chimera checking.
